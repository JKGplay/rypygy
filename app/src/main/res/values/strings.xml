        After a while of wandering, you realize that you don\'t see much. There is some kind of fog
        floating in the air. Suddenly, you feel someone\'s gaze upon you. You nervously look around.
        Eventually, you see a shady individual. He starts to walk towards you. You are preparing for
        a fight, but luckily, you recognize him in time. His name\'s Fred. He\'s a friendly guy that
        you know by sight (you spoke with him once or twice). As he approaches you, you see that
        this weird fog is actually cigarette smoke that comes out of his mouth, nose, and, well,
        his cigarette. He greets you:&lt;br/>
        -Hello %1$s, I wouldn\'t guess I\'ll find you here.&lt;br/>
        -Yeah… I\'m just wandering around.&lt;br/>
        -By the way, I heard rumors that you want to fight Kunczka.&lt;br/>
        -Yes, that\'s right.&lt;br/>
        -In that case, I can share with you some useful information about the most common Forest
        inhabitant - the First-Year. They\'re relatively easy to defeat - the secret lies in…&lt;br/>
        And he continues talking for the rest of the day. With that new knowledge, you feel stronger
        in fights against First-Years.&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>You got 10%% damage boost against First-Years!&lt;/b>

        You meet Fred. He doesn\'t have anything more to say to help you with First-Years, but you talk all day anyway.
